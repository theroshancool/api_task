# Django Project: App Management API

## Overview
This is a Django-based project with API endpoints for managing app details. It allows you to:
- Add a new app to the database.
- Retrieve app details by ID.
- Delete an app by ID.

## Features
- Built with Django.
- SQLite database for development (easy to configure for PostgreSQL).
- RESTful API for managing app details.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
1. Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Pip (Python package manager).
3. Virtualenv (optional but recommended).
4. Git (optional, for cloning the repository).

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
If the code is hosted on a version control system (e.g., GitHub):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Or, if working locally, navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/project



2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv        # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate   # Activate on Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Activate on Windows
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure the Database
By default, this project uses SQLite (no setup required). If you want to use PostgreSQL, update DATABASES in the settings.py file.

Run the following commands to apply migrations:

bash

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
5. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:

bash

python manage.py runserver
The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

6. Test the API Endpoints
You can use tools like Postman or curl to test the API.
