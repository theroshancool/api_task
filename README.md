- Retrieve app details by ID.
- Delete an app by ID.

## Features
- Built with Django.
- SQLite database for development (easy to configure for PostgreSQL).
- RESTful API for managing app details.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
1. Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Pip (Python package manager).
3. Virtualenv (optional but recommended).
4. Git (optional, for cloning the repository).

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
If the code is hosted on a version control system (e.g., GitHub):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theroshancool/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

Or, if working locally, navigate to the project folder:

cd /path/to/your/project

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv        # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate   # Activate on Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Activate on Windows
